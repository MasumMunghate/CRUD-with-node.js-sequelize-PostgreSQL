## Overview

This project is designed to manage and perform CRUD operations efficiently using Sequelize as the ORM and PostgreSQL as the database. The project uses a structured approach to handle controllers, routes, services, and validation, making the codebase easy to manage and scalable.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Sequelize**: Promise-based ORM for Node.js and PostgreSQL
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system
- **Joi**: Validation library for handling request data validation
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js

## Project Structure

The project is organized into various folders to maintain a clean and scalable architecture:

- **config**: Configuration files, including database setup and connectivity
- **controllers**: Logic to handle incoming requests and responses
- **migrations**: Database migration files for versioning and modifying the schema
- **models**: Sequelize models representing database tables
- **routes**: Route definitions and API endpoints
- **validation**: Joi schemas to validate request payloads
- **seeders**: Scripts to populate the database with initial data
- **services**: Business logic and reusable functions

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. **Install Dependencies:**:
   npm install
3. **Configure Environment Variables:**:
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=yourDatabaseUser
   DB_PASSWORD=yourDatabasePassword
   DB_NAME=yourDatabaseName
   DB_PORT=5432
3. **Run Migrations**:
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
4. **Start the Server**:
   npm start
   
## Usage
• API Endpoints: Use tools like Postman or cURL to test the CRUD operations.
• Validation: All incoming requests are validated using Joi to ensure data integrity.

## Database Configuration
• The database connection is configured using Sequelize. The config folder contains a file for setting up the PostgreSQL connection. Adjust the settings in the .env file as needed to match your local or production environment.

## Joi Validation
• The project uses Joi to validate incoming request data, ensuring that only valid and correctly structured data is processed by the server.
